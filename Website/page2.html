      <h3>National Recognition (1991-2000)</h3>
  <p>The 1990s marked a significant turning point for Jeff's Burgers. In 1992, the chain launched its first nationwide marketing campaign, featuring the slogan “Fresh. Fast. Flavorful.” The campaign resonated with consumers, leading to a dramatic increase in sales and recognition. In 1995, Jeff’s Burgers received accolades from food critics and was featured in several culinary magazines, which further solidified its reputation. The introduction of a kids' menu and partnerships with local schools for healthy eating initiatives also helped boost its popularity among families.</p>

      <h3>Going Global (2001-2010)</h3>
  <p>By the early 2000s, Jeff's Burgers had established a loyal customer base and began looking beyond Canadian borders. In 2003, the first international location opened in the U.S, followed by expansions into Europe and Asia. The brand adapted its menu to cater to local tastes, introducing items like teriyaki burgers in Japan. During this decade, Jeff’s Burgers also embraced technology, launching a user-friendly app for mobile ordering and delivery, which helped it stay competitive in the evolving fast-food landscape.</p>
