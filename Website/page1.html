    <h3>Founding Years (1975-1980)</h3>
  <p>Jeff's Burgers began as a modest venture in a small town in BC, founded by Jeff Reynolds, a culinary school graduate with a passion for classic Canadian fare. Inspired by his family's backyard barbecues, Jeff envisioned a restaurant that combined the essence of homemade burgers with fast-food convenience. The first location opened in 1975, featuring a simple menu of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries, and shakes.</p>

    <h3>Expansion and Innovation (1981-1990)</h3>
  <p>By the early 1980s, word of mouth had spread about Jeff's unique approach to burgersâ€”using fresh, locally sourced ingredients and offering customizable options. This appealed to a growing demographic seeking quality in fast food. In 1983, Jeff's Burgers expanded to neighboring towns, and by 1989, the chain had over 20 locations across the province. During this period, Jeff introduced several innovations, including the "Build Your Own Burger" option, allowing customers to choose from a variety of toppings, sauces, and buns. This initiative set the chain apart from competitors and became a defining feature of the brand.</p>
