        <h3>Sustainability and Health Focus (2011-2020)</h3>
  <p>As consumer preferences shifted towards healthier and more sustainable options, Jeff’s Burgers responded by revamping its menu. In 2012, the chain committed to using 100% grass-fed beef and free-range chicken, as well as sourcing organic produce. A range of plant-based burgers was introduced in 2016, appealing to the growing vegetarian and vegan market. The company also initiated eco-friendly practices, including reducing plastic use and implementing recycling programs in all locations, earning praise for its commitment to sustainability.</p>

  <p>Today, Jeff's Burgers boasts over 35000 locations worldwide and continues to thrive. The brand has become synonymous with quality and innovation in the fast-food industry. In 2023, the chain launched a new line of gourmet burgers, featuring unique flavor combinations inspired by global cuisines, and introduced a rewards program that has attracted millions of members.
